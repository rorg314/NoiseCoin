# NoiseCoin

This repository contains initial modelling and a python prototype for a random noise based cryptocurrency. The currency utilises random noise to calculate a proportion of tokens to mint or burn after a transaction has completed - aiming to stimulate short term volatility, whilst decreasing the total supply over time aiming to stimulate value/demand.
